"""Tests for on-demand (QA-time) indexing and the upgraded grounded LLM layer.

Contract under test:
* search returns metadata fast and NEVER downloads or indexes full text;
* PDFs are fetched/chunked/embedded only when a paper is selected for QA;
* answers are structured, cited, and cannot carry unsupported citations.
