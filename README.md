# Real-Time Semantic Search Engine for Research Papers

A hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform for arXiv research papers.
It combines **BM25 sparse retrieval** and **dense semantic retrieval** with
**cross-encoder reranking**, **lazy PDF loading**, **structure-aware chunking**,
a **FAISS vector database**, and **single- / multi-document question answering**
with map-reduce synthesis and source attribution — behind a **FastAPI** backend
and **Streamlit** frontend, with **PostgreSQL/SQLite** metadata storage and a
built-in **Recall@k / MRR / nDCG** evaluation harness.

## Requirement traceability

| Report / Review-2 requirement | Where implemented |
|---|---|
| Natural-language queries, normalization + expansion | `services/query_processor.py` |
| Real-time arXiv API ingestion (direct Atom API, hard 8s timeout — a slow arXiv route can never hang search), metadata management | `services/arxiv_client.py`, `scripts/ingest.py` |
| Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense embeddings), parallel | `services/retrieval/` (`bm25_retriever`, `dense_retriever`, `hybrid`) |
| Adaptive fusion (not fixed weights) | `retrieval/fusion.py` — RRF + weighted fusion with **dynamic alpha tuning** (per-query, DAT-inspired, ref [1]) |
| Cross-encoder reranking | `services/reranker.py` (ms-marco cross-encoder; lexical fallback) |
| Corrective/adaptive retrieval (re-query on low confidence) | `services/pipeline.py::search` (Corrective-RAG-style, ref [9]) |
| Lazy PDF loading — download & index **only when a paper is selected for QA**; search stays metadata-only | `services/documents/loader.py`, `pipeline.ensure_paper_indexed` (called from `ask_single`/`ask_multi`, never from `search`) |
| Structure-aware chunking with section metadata | `services/documents/chunker.py` (font-size heading detection → canonical sections → sentence-boundary chunks w/ overlap) |
| FAISS vector database + metadata filtering | `services/vector_store.py` (IndexFlatIP → IVF at scale; **post-filtering** per ref [14]) |
| Single-document QA (focused, multi-turn follow-ups) | `services/qa/engine.py::answer_single` |
| Multi-document QA with **map-reduce** synthesis | `services/qa/engine.py::answer_multi` |
| LLM generation with source attribution, open-source LLMs | `services/llm/generator.py` (extractive / HuggingFace local / OpenAI-compatible e.g. Ollama) |
| Recommendations for related papers | `services/recommender.py` |
| REST APIs for retrieval & query operations | `backend/app/api/routes/api.py` (`/search`, `/qa/*`, `/papers/*`, `/admin/*`) |
| Streamlit web interface | `frontend/streamlit_app.py` (Search, Single-QA chat, Multi-QA, Recommendations, Admin) |
| PostgreSQL metadata storage | SQLAlchemy models (`db/models.py`); `DATABASE_URL` switches SQLite↔PostgreSQL |
| No duplicate indexing | unique `arxiv_id` constraint + dedup in retrievers + idempotent chunk indexing |
| Graceful PDF-failure handling | loader never raises; abstract-only fallback, error stored on the paper row |
| Evaluation: Recall@k, MRR, nDCG; sparse vs dense vs hybrid | `evaluation/evaluate.py` |
| Admin: rebuild indexes, stats, query history | `/api/v1/admin/*` + Admin tab in UI |

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. install  (minimal — runs anywhere, lexical fallbacks)
pip install -r requirements.txt
#    or the full ML stack (real embeddings, cross-encoder, local LLMs):
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt

# 2. start the backend
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload          # http://localhost:8000/docs

# 3. start the frontend (new terminal)
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py        # http://localhost:8501

# 4. (optional) pre-ingest a corpus
#    Cold start note: on first run with an empty corpus, the app
#    auto-ingests the bundled seed corpus (seed/arxiv_seed.jsonl — 46
#    canonical IR/RAG/NLP papers with condensed summary abstracts), so
#    search works immediately even if the arXiv API is unreachable or
#    rate-limiting you. Re-run it any time with:
python -m scripts.ingest --seed
python -m scripts.ingest --arxiv-query "retrieval augmented generation" --max 200
python -m scripts.ingest --categories cs.IR cs.CL --max 300
# or from the Kaggle arXiv snapshot (the deck's primary dataset):
python -m scripts.ingest --kaggle-json arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json --max 5000
```

Searching in the UI with "Fetch fresh papers from arXiv" enabled ingests new
papers in real time; you don't have to pre-ingest anything.

### LLM configuration (auto-selects the strongest available)

`LLM_BACKEND=auto` (default) probes at startup and picks the best backend
present on your machine:

| Priority | Backend | What it gives you | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `openai-compatible` | Strong generative answers from **Ollama** / vLLM / LM Studio (default model `llama3.1:8b`) | endpoint at `LLM_API_BASE` |
| 2 | `hf` | Local **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct** via transformers | `requirements-ml.txt`, GPU recommended |
| 3 | `extractive` | Citation-grounded sentence synthesis (MMR selection). Cannot hallucinate. | nothing |

Recommended: install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`,
start the backend — it is detected automatically. Use `qwen2.5:14b` or
`llama3.3` via `LLM_API_MODEL` for even stronger answers.

**Grounding guard** (`LLM_GROUNDING_CHECK=true`): every generative answer is
post-validated against its retrieved sources — citations to non-existent
sources are stripped, and an answer making claims with *no* valid citation is
regenerated with the extractive backend, so unsupported claims never reach
the user. All prompts enforce a strict contract: answer only from numbered
excerpts, cite every claim as `[n]`, state explicitly when the context lacks
the answer, and structure responses as a direct answer followed by
explanation. `GET /admin/stats` shows which backend/model was resolved.

## API overview (`/api/v1`)

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /search` | Hybrid retrieve → rerank; returns ranked paper metadata (no PDF downloads — fast) |
| `POST /qa/single` | Question answering over one paper (multi-turn `history` supported) |
| `POST /qa/multi` | Map-reduce QA across selected papers (or let retrieval pick) |
| `GET /papers/{id}` | Paper metadata + indexing status |
| `POST /papers/{id}/index` | On-demand download+parse+chunk+embed (auto-invoked when a paper is selected for QA) |
| `GET /papers/{id}/recommendations` | Related papers (embedding + category similarity) |
| `GET /admin/stats` · `POST /admin/rebuild` · `GET /admin/history` | Operations |

Interactive docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Evaluation

```bash
python -m evaluation.evaluate --eval-file evaluation/datasets/sample_eval.jsonl --k 1 5 10
```

Prints Recall@k, MRR, and nDCG@k for `bm25`, `dense`, `hybrid`, and
`hybrid+rerank` side-by-side. Eval sets are JSONL:
`{"query": "...", "relevant": ["<arxiv_id>", ...]}` — build one for your
ingested corpus to reproduce the report's Phase-2 comparison.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q        # 44 tests, fully offline
```

Covers: query processing, dynamic-alpha fusion, BM25/dense/hybrid retrieval,
reranking, PDF parsing + structure-aware chunking (against a generated PDF),
graceful PDF failure, FAISS filtering/persistence, dedup, lazy-index
idempotency, single & multi-doc QA, conversation history, recommendations,
all API routes, the metric implementations, plus the on-demand-indexing contract (search never downloads; QA selection triggers indexing) and the citation/grounding guard.

## Docker deployment (with PostgreSQL)

```bash
docker compose up --build
# frontend :8501 · api :8000 · postgres :5432
```

## Architecture notes & design decisions

* **Two-level retrieval, strictly deferred full text.** Paper-level hybrid
  retrieval over title+abstract answers *search* from metadata alone —
  PDFs are downloaded, parsed, chunked, and embedded only at the moment a
  paper is selected for Single- or Multi-Paper QA (idempotently, so the
  cost is paid once per paper). Chunk-level FAISS retrieval with metadata
  filters then serves QA, with chunk candidates reranked before the LLM.
* **Fusion.** RRF is the default (scale-free, robust). Weighted fusion with
  **dynamic alpha** is available: query traits (acronyms, quoted phrases,
  length, math tokens) shift weight toward BM25 for technical lookups and
  toward dense retrieval for conceptual questions — the adaptive behavior the
  report's research-gap analysis calls for.
* **Structure-aware chunking.** Headings are detected from PDF font
  geometry at line level, mapped to canonical sections (abstract,
  introduction, methodology, experiments, results, …); references/appendix
  are dropped; chunks respect sentence boundaries with sentence-level
  overlap and carry their section as filterable metadata.
* **Fast search, visible costs.** Models (embedder + cross-encoder) are
  warmed at startup so the first query doesn't pay model-load time; the
  live arXiv fetch is capped (15 candidates, single HTTP request) and
  the corrective retry re-queries local indexes only. Search responses
  include a `timings_ms` breakdown (arXiv fetch vs retrieval+rerank),
  shown in the UI, so any slowness is immediately attributable. When
  the live fetch fails or times out, the response carries a `notice`
  explaining what happened and what to do (shown as a warning banner),
  and search continues over the local corpus. The live fetch is also
  polite by design: identical queries are cached for 5 minutes,
  uncached fetches are spaced ≥3s apart, and HTTP 429/503 responses
  are reported explicitly as arXiv rate limiting — repeated searches
  can no longer trigger or be stalled by rate limits.
* **Robust QA matching + diagnostics.** Extractive evidence matching
  uses stemmed content words ("compare the results" matches "the
  result shows"), map calls across papers run in parallel, and when no
  evidence is found the answer names each paper's reason (indexing
  failed vs. nothing matched) with rephrasing guidance instead of a
  blanket failure message.
* **Graceful degradation everywhere.** No torch → hash embedder + lexical
  reranker; no LLM → extractive grounded answers; unreachable/broken PDF →
  abstract-only indexing; arXiv API down → local corpus. A query can always
  be answered; components upgrade quality when their dependencies exist.
* **Scaling path.** Flat FAISS indexes are exact and fastest below ~1M
  vectors; `maybe_train_ivf()` upgrades to IVF beyond a threshold, and
  metadata filtering uses post-filtering to preserve index efficiency.
